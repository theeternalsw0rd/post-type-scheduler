This plugin will allow for scheduling any content in any post type via Custom Fields. This will filter any content with a published state looking for start and stop dates/times as well as being able to specify the active taxonomy for the duration. 

This is intended to be a generic plugin, but the primary focus of the development will be on creating dynamic slideshows that update based on the content scheduling.
