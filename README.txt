This is a simple plugin that will associate a schedule to any post type entry via a metabox. If the metabox has valid input, it will create a post-meta key of _post_schedule with a value that is a JSON string which can be utilized in themes or other plugins. This plugin is still under preliminary development, but eventually this README will contain the JSON structure so code can be utilized in themes or other plugins to make use of the schedules.
