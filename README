This plugin will allow for scheduling images to appear in a slideshow which can be inserted into a post/page and updated automatically with ajax. The primary purpose is for kiosk systems but should be compatible with normal website usage as well.

For segmented control, we aim to utilize post types and roles to allow for multiple slideshows to be controllable by different people. The idea would be to create a role and at the same time create the post type for that role. Only those within the role would have access to that post type (plus admins and superadmins).

If the slideshow is only a single image, it should remain static, and if there are no images, it should be set to display:none.
