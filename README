This plugin will allow for scheduling images to appear in a slideshow which can be inserted into a post/page and updated automatically with ajax. The primary purpose is for kiosk systems but should be compatible with normal website usage as well.

If the slideshow is only a single image, it should remain static, and if there are no images, it should be set to display:none.
